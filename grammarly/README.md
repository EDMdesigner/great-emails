## Grammarly's one-fit-all template

Grammarly use this master template for all of their marketing and transactional communications.
They have nicely designed blocks that they use based on the content of the email.
This is one of the longest email they send - it's the weekly digest for the newcomers.

The whole email is personalized. Every section holds some "personal" information about my writing style, productivity and achievments.

My favorite part is the image in the end that display what kind of tools from grammarly I use.
This is tricky since it's an image, so they had to automatically choose the image that applies to me based on my data in DB.

There are some great ideas in this email that could help maintain retention for new users ;)
