# great-emails

We started this repository at [chamaileon.io](https://chamaileon.io?utm_source=github-greatemails) because we wanted to collect emails we like. It's mostly about motivation, be it a nice code, design or a cool/surprising solutionon for something.

We decided to publish this repo, because sharing is caring. You can also add your favorite emails here!
